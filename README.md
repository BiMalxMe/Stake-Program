Solana Staking Program

This program allows users to stake SOL tokens, accumulate reward points over time based on the staked amount, and claim those points.

Features

- Create a PDA account to store user staking data.
- Stake SOL tokens to start earning points.
- Unstake SOL tokens to withdraw your stake.
- Claim accumulated reward points.
- Check current points without claiming.

How it works

- When you stake SOL, the program tracks your staked amount and the time.
- Points are calculated based on the amount staked and the time elapsed.
- You can unstake any amount up to your staked balance.
- Points can be claimed separately.
- The program uses PDAs to securely manage each userâ€™s staking data.
